================================= SIMPLE SIMON


-- Simon Introduction --

    As a pair, develop a basic version, then a unique take, on the Simple Simon game (based on 80s Simon board game)

    Examples

    Up next...

        1) Set up enviroment
        2) Plan out all rules in great detail for basic version and pseudo code project
        3) Pair program minimum viable product (MVP)
        4) Pair program and style unique take on the Simple Simon game
    

-- Expectations --

    - Work together as a team (not as two individuals)
        Together, plan the project
        One person write code (driver)
        One person should observe, strategize, give feedback/suggestions (navigator)
        
    - Alternate frequently between driving/navigating about every 30 minutes

    - Don't use eval()

    - Commit frequently (entire project should be at least 30 commits)


-- Suggestions -- 

    - Use jQuery syntax where possible

    - Work first to complete fully functional version before extra styling and features


-- Project Set Up --

    Pair up

    BOTH team members do the following...
    
        1) Follow curriculum setup steps 1 - 3 (NOT INCLUDING STEP 4!)

    First team member ONLY...
        1) Create organization on GitHub
        2) Add teammate to organization
        3) Complete step 4 from curriculum setup steps
        4) Add and commit index.html file 
        5) Create remote repo on GitHub based on your local repo
        6) Push up all commits to the newly created remote repository on GitHub

    Second team member ONLY...
        1) Go to your organizations page and simple-simon repo
        2) Click the link to clone the repo address
        3) cd into ~/vagrant-lamp/sites/simplesimon.dev folder
        4) Type "rm -rf public"
        5) Hit enter
        6) Type "git clone [paste address here] ."  (no actual square brackets should be around the address and don't forget the dot)
        7) Type "subl .gitignore" and hit enter then save and close the empty file
        8) Add and commit .gitignore file
        9) cd into the public folder and use the "mkdir" to create folders for css, js, img, and sound
        10) Add and commit these folders
        11) Create main.css and main.js files
        12) Add and commit these files
        13) Once all additional files and folders are added and committed, type "git push origin master" and hit enter

    First team member ONLY...
        1) Type "git pull origin master" and hit enter
        2) Make a small change to the index.html file like adding the basic tags of an HTML script
        3) Add and commit the change to index.html
        4) Type git push origin master

    Second team member ONLY...
        1) Type "git pull origin master" and hit enter
        2) You are now free to begin planning the project



-- Project Planning --

    As a pair, write out the rules for Simple Simon in great detail.

    Pseudo code as detailed as possible the logic of your project (remember to focus on the basic version first).

    Aim to spend at least an hour planning the project.

    Consider extra features and styling (a possible theme) for the unique version of the project.

    Once the project is adequetly planned, begin pair programming, using the curriculum steps as a guide.
