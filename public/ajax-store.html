        // if you're going to make an ajax request
        // setup both your .done and .fail methods

        // 1st draft of .fail is console.log("fail")
        // 1st draft of .done is console.log("done method fired")

        // 2nd draft of .fail method is to console.log the results
        // 2nd draft of .done method is to console.log the results

    // put the contents on the page w/ html
        // contents of inventory.json will be JSON format
        // name those contents a variable called contents

        // Determine the "shape" of those contentsby expanding them inside your console.
            // By "shape", answer the following questions:
                // is the result from contents a string
                // is the "shape" an object? {}
                // is the shape an array []

            // If contents is an array, we're probably going to iterate across that array
            // if contents are an object, we'll need to explore that object and the shape of its properties  
            
            // Identify what data needs to go where into what HTML structure... type out the HTML manually w/ hard coded data if you have to

    // if the shape of our data is an array, ignore any loops and make a solution for only the first element on that array

    // Wishful thinking: ignore as much of the problem as you can, focus on the smallest steps where less goes wrong

    // once we have a solution working for the first element of an array, we can manually iterate to make sure our thinking is clear

    // example of manually iterating:
    // var array = ['bob', 'jane', 'tarzan'];
    // var index = 0;
    // console.log("first element is " + array[index]);
    // index++;
    // console.log("second element is " + array[index]);
    // index++;
    // console.log("third element is " + array[index]);
    // index++;
    // console.log("fourth element is " + array[index]);
    // if you get undefined then we've reached the end of the array


    // make a loop around that array
